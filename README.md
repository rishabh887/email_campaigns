####### Email Engagement Prediction Project  ########

## Overview
This project aims to predict email engagement using machine learning, specifically a RandomForestClassifier. The model is developed to analyze and predict whether an email will be opened based on various features.

## Files
- **email_engagement_prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the data and handled missing values.
- **Model Development:** Used a RandomForestClassifier.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Key Findings
- Achieved an overall accuracy of 87%.
